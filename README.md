# Image Classifier Project

This project is part of Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree.  
The goal is to build an image classifier that recognizes 102 types of flowers.

## Project Description

- Build and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
- Use transfer learning with MobileNet to classify flower images.
- Create a command line application (`predict.py`) to make predictions on new images.
- Use a label mapping JSON file to convert class indices to flower names.

## Files in This Repository

- `Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for building and training the model.
- `predict.py`: Python script for predicting flower classes from images.
- `label_map.json`: JSON file mapping class numbers to flower names.
- `test_images/`: Folder with sample flower images for testing.
- `my_model.h5`: Saved Keras model file (your trained model).

## How to Use

Run the prediction script from the command line like this:

```bash
python predict.py /path/to/image my_model.h5 --top_k 5 --category_names label_map.json
